# Time-Series-Forecasting

This project analyses the power consumption by one household with one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years (2006-2010). The dataset is multivariate and
uses time series analysis. It has 2.07 million rows and 9 features containing different electrical quantites and sub-metering. Various graphs and charts are made and 
used to find meaningful inferences. This is then followed by building a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model under Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to predict power 
consumption for the future years. Power BI was also used to create a dashboard summarizing the dataset and inferences.
